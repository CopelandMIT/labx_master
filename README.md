LabX Master is the central repository for a synchronized distributed sensor network project. It integrates multiple sensors (60GHz Infineon FMCW radar, USB cameras, GPS modules) controlled by SBCs, and utilizes NTP and PPS GPS for time sync. The MSI server handles data collection, synchronization, and analysis for research applications.
